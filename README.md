**The official command-line interface for the [Stabilize ORM](https://github.com/ElectronSz/stabilize-orm).**

---

`stabilize-cli` is the essential companion tool for the Stabilize ORM, providing a powerful set of commands to manage your database schema, generate files, and run development tasks directly from your terminal.

---

## üöÄ Features

-   **Code Generation**: Instantly scaffold new models, migrations, and seed files with a single command.
-   **Schema Management**: Automatically generate database-specific SQL migrations from your existing models.
-   **Database Tooling**: Run migrations, roll them back, and check their status against the database.
-   **Data Seeding**: Populate your database with test data, manage seed history, and respect dependencies between seed files.
-   **Workflow Automation**: A powerful `db:reset` command to completely drop, migrate, and seed your database for a clean development slate.

---

## üì¶ Installation

For the best experience, install the CLI globally using your preferred package manager.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g stabilize-cli

# Using Bun
bun add -g stabilize-cli
```

After installation, the `stabilize` command will be available in your terminal.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

The Stabilize CLI is designed to work within a project that has `stabilize-orm` installed and configured. It automatically looks for a `config/database.ts` file in your project's root directory to connect to the database.

## üíª Commands

All commands are run using the `stabilize` executable.
