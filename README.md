**The official command-line interface for the [Stabilize ORM](https://github.com/ElectronSz/stabilize-orm).**

---

`stabilize-cli` is the essential companion tool for Stabilize ORM, providing a powerful set of commands to manage your database schema, generate files, and run development tasks directly from your terminal.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Code Generation**: Instantly scaffold new models, migrations, and seed files with a single command.
- **Flexible Field Arguments for Models**: Pass column definitions as arguments to `generate model`, e.g., `name:string active:boolean`.
- **Multi-Row Seeding**: Use `--count <number>` (or `-n <number>`) with `generate seed` to control how many seed rows are generated, using the model's schema.
- **Schema Management**: Automatically generate database-specific SQL migrations from your existing models.
- **Lifecycle Hooks Support**: Scaffold models with hooks defined in `ModelConfig` or as class methods for `beforeCreate`, `afterUpdate`, etc.
- **Soft Deletes & Versioning**: Scaffold models with `softDelete` and `versioned` options for audit, rollback, and time-travel support.
- **Database Tooling**: Run migrations, roll them back, and check their status against the database.
- **Data Seeding with Dependencies**: Populate your database with test data, manage seed history, and respect dependencies between seed files.
- **Cross-DB Compatibility**: Seed and migration history tables are now created with auto-increment `id` and proper string/timestamp types for MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite.
- **Workflow Automation**: A powerful `db:reset` command to drop, migrate, and seed your database for a clean development slate, with a `--force` flag for non-interactive use.
- **TypeScript & Modern Bun Support**: All files generated are TypeScript-first, designed for Bun runtimes.

## üì¶ Installation

For the best experience, install the CLI globally using your preferred package manager.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g stabilize-cli

# Using Bun
bun add -g stabilize-cli
```

After installation, the `stabilize-cli` command will be available in your terminal.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

The Stabilize CLI is designed to work within a project that has `stabilize-orm@^1.3.0` installed and configured. It automatically looks for a `config/database.ts` file in your project's root directory to connect to the database.

---

## üíª Commands

All commands are run using the `stabilize-cli` executable.

| Command                            | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate model <Name> [fields...]`         | Creates a new model file in `models/` with hooks, soft delete, and versioning. Pass column definitions as extra arguments (e.g. `name:string active:boolean`). |
| `generate migration <ModelName>`   | Generates a new SQL migration from an existing model.                       |
| `generate seed <SeedName>`         | Creates a new seed file in `seeds/`, based on the model schema. Use `--count <number>` or `-n <number>` to control number of rows. |
| `migrate`                          | Applies all pending migrations to the database.                             |
| `migrate:rollback`                 | Rolls back the most recently applied migration.                             |
| `seed`                             | Runs all pending seed files, respecting dependencies.                       |
| `seed:rollback`                    | Rolls back the most recently applied seed.                                  |
| `status`                           | Shows the status (`APPLIED` or `PENDING`) of all migration and seed files.  |
| `db:drop [--force]`                | Drops all tables in the database. Use `--force` to skip confirmation. **Use with caution.** |
| `db:reset [--force]`               | Drops, migrates, and seeds the database. Use `--force` to skip confirmation. For development only. |

### Command Examples

**Generating a new `User` model with custom fields:**
```bash
stabilize-cli generate model User name:string active:boolean email:string
# ‚úî Success: Model generated: models/User.ts
```

**Generating a seed file for `User` with 10 rows (uses model's schema):**
```bash
stabilize-cli generate seed User --count 10
# ‚úî Success: Seed generated: seeds/20251019135400_User.ts
```

**Generating a migration from the `Product` model:**
```bash
stabilize-cli generate migration Product
# ‚úî Success: Migration generated: migrations/20251018203000_create_product_table.json
```

**Applying all pending migrations:**
```bash
stabilize-cli migrate
# ‚úî All pending migrations applied.
```

**Applying all pending seeds:**
```bash
stabilize-cli seed
# ‚úî Successfully applied 1 seed(s).
```

**Resetting the database non-interactively:**
```bash
stabilize-cli db:reset --force
# ‚úî Database reset complete.
```

**Checking the status of your database:**
```bash
stabilize-cli status

# Migration Status
# ---------------------------------
# [ APPLIED ] 20251018203000_create_product_table
#
# Seed Status
# ---------------------------------
# [ PENDING ] 20251018203000_Product
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Advanced Usage

### Model Generation with Hooks and Soft Delete

By default, generated models include:
- `versioned: true` for audit and time-travel support.
- `softDelete: true` with a `deletedAt` column for soft deletes.
- Lifecycle hooks defined in `ModelConfig` and as class methods.
- **Custom columns**: Pass fields as arguments, e.g. `name:string isActive:boolean createdAt:date`.

```bash
stabilize-cli generate model Product name:string category:string price:numeric
```
